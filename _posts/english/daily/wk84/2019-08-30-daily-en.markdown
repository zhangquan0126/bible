### Question     
What was God's will for those Israelites who were in exile?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The leaders of the people and those who were plotting evil were slaughtered. 

+ The Lord would deliver them into the hands of foreigners and inflict punishment on them. 

+ Although the Lord sent them far away among the nations, yet for a little while He have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where have gone. 

+ The Lord will give them an undivided heart and put a spirit in them then they will follow Him as His people. 

+ The glory of the Lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountains east of it. The spirit lifted Ezekiel up and brought him to the exiles in Babylonia. 

+ The Lord commanded Ezekiel to pack belongings for exile, as a sign to the prince of Jerusalem that they would go in exile as captives. 

+ The Lord said this about those living in Jerusalem and Israel: They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Those who remained in Jerusalem thought the exiles were forsaken by the Lord. But God promised salvation for those were in exile. Do I feel forsaken by God when I encounter difficulties? How does God's promise help me?
