### Question     
What was God's tenth plague when Pharaoh's heart was still hardened and refused to let the Israelites go?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Many Jewish holidays came directly from God. Passover was one of them. It was to commemorate the blessings they received when God lead them out of Egypt. 

+ They followed God's command by putting the blood of lamb on the door frames. Any family did not do so had their first born killed. Israel must kill the lamb and protect themselves with its blood. This foretells Jesus Christ as the lamb that bleed for all men's sins. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Eating in hast on the Passover, putting on travel clothing, and getting ready to leave are Israelites' display of faith. They acted on the faith for God's promise to lead them out of Egypt. Do I need faith to prepare myself for God's promises that are yet to come? 

+ **Fidelity** - Moses summoned all the elders to give them the instructions for Passover. Everyone obeyed willingly. Obeying God's commands, Moses and Arron finally got the respect from Israelites. How does this remind me of those who serve God? How I should view them?
