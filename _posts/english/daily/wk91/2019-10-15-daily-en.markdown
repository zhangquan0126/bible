{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ephraim pursues multiplies lies and violence. He makes a treaty with Assyria and sends olive oil to Egypt. 
+ The Lord has a charge to bring against Judah; he will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds. 
+ Ephraim has aroused his bitter anger; his Lord will leave on him the guilt of his bloodshed. 
+ Ephraim became guilty of Baal worship. Now they sin more and more; they make idols for themselves from their silver. 
+ When God fed them, they were satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; then they forgot God. 
+ The guilt of Ephraim is stored up, his sins are kept on record. His storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures. 
+ Samaria must bear their guilt, because they have rebelled against their God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Israelites were satisfied when God fed them; when they were satisfied, the became proud; then they forgot God. By whom are we fed? Do I give thanks to God or am I proud of my own success?
