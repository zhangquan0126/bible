### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it and keeps hands from doing any evil. 

+ For my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations. 

+ Rebukes the Judah for being rebellious and treacherous, but whoever takes refuge in Him will inherit the land. 

+ The Lord lives in a high and holy place, but also with the one who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Integrity** - The wicked are like the tossing sea, "There is no peace, for the wicked." Am I still full of guilt and sin and unable to let go? Please ask the Holy Spirit to help me, to forsake the sins that has being bonding me to receive peace from God's grace.
