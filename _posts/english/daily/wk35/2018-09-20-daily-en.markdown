### Question     
What did Paul encounter on the way to Rome?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ Angel appeared to Paul and told him that all on the ship would be saved. 

+ Protected by God, Paul was not harmed by snake’s bite. 

+ Arrived in Rome.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** – Seeing what God has revealed to Paul, we often moan in not hearing from God. However, we frequently forget that we rarely walk in God’s presence and we seldom put our faith completely in Him. I shall examine myself regularly to ensure that I’m walking on His path and making His commission as my mission.  

+ **Integrity** – Paul relied on God when surrounded by troubles as he said in Philippians 4:13, I can do all this through him who gives me strength. Am I still trying to overcome difficulties by my own strength? Do I have faith in God alone and am willing to let Him take control and follow Him whole heartedly? 

+ **Integrity** – Julius is a Roman centurion responsible to transfer Paul to Rome. His treatment to Paul was unusual as he was lenient to Paul (27:3) and later saved Paul’s live (27:43). What caused Julius to do these to Paul? Does my life’s integrity show through and how do others see me?
