### Question     
What happened to descendants of Israel in Egypt?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The background of Exodus. The curtain raiser of God's salvation plan. 

+ Israelite were tortured in Egypt, but they grew stronger with God's blessing. Moses was born and saved by God when Pharaoh was killing all new born Hebrew boys. We must remember God is always in control no matter what dangers and circumstances we may face.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The God-fearing midwives saved the life of eventual Exodus leader, Moses. Am I God-fearing and willing to walk with Him under any circumstances? 

+ **Identity** - All Hebrew baby boys were being killed when Moses was born. Through God's blessing he was taken by Pharaoh's daughter and grew up in the palace. He killed a person and fled to Midian. When God equips a man, everything happens to him comes from God for his good. How does knowing this fact help me identify myself and recognize my own experiences positively?
