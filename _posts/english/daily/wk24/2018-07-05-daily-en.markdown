### Question     
What did Jesus teach us about how to live our lives?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus called the first disciples: "Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people." Jesus traveled throughout Galilee to preach Gospel, to heal the sick, and to drive out evil spirits. Many followed Him. 

+ Jesus preached to those who followed Him the Gospel from heaven which is the Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:29). Today's reading covers 5:1-6:18 which includes the Beatitude (5:3-11), God's people's responsibility of being the salt and light of the world (5:12-16), how God's people should live their lives, and the true Godly spiritual life (6:1-18). 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - What is the true blessing? What blessings am I pursuing? How does Jesus' teaching help me change my view on blessings? From Jesus' teaching on what our daily and spiritual life ought to be, what changes do I need to ask God to help me on? 

+ **Fidelity** - God's people are the salt and light of the world. What are the functions of salt and light? How do I make use of these functions? Looking back, what opportunities did God give me to be the salt and light? Did I grab onto those opportunities?
