{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The people of Bethel entreat the Lord and ask Him if they should mourn and fast in the fifth month, as they have done for so many years. 

+ The Lord was not pleased when they fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months because it was not for Him. 

+ The Lord called but they did not listen. He scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. 

+ The Lord will return to Zion and dwell in Jerusalem. 

+ The Lord has determined to do good again to Jerusalem and Judah. Do not be afraid. 

+ The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for Judah. Therefore love truth and peace. 

+ Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord Almighty and to entreat Him. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - The Lord wants Israel to administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other. Am I obeying His will?
