### Question     
What are the deeds filled with holiness, wisdom, and faithfulness like?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Seek wisdom from heaven and tame our tongues; we shall not curse human beings while praise our God at the same time. 

+ Do not let loose our desires, do not be friend with the world; Submit to God and obey Him, wash our hands and purify our hearts, repent and humble before God, go near God, do not judge other. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - A faith without deeds is dead and useless. But what deeds display fully a faith that is alive? On subjects of taming the tongue, seeking the wisdom, attitude toward worldly norms, judging myself and others, what kind of deeds does a lively faith bring out? What is most meaningful to me? 

+ **Integrity** - How is the wisdom we ought to seek according to chapter 3 different from the wisdom of the world? No human can tame the tongue, so we need the wisdom from heaven to tame it. How does the wisdom from heaven help us tame our tongues (3:17)? What is the reason for quarrel and fight between people? What are the causes for us to desire what we don't have (4:1-3)? What is the attitude of my prayers?
