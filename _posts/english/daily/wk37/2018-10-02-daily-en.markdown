### Question     
Through what are we saved?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ We are elected through God's grace by faith. 

+ We are elected through Jesus Christ who is the culmination of the laws and through His death and resurrection for us. Everyone who calls on His name will be saved. To call on His name, one needs to believe. To believe, one needs to hear gospel. To hear gospel, one needs to be preached. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Jews had zeal but no knowledge. Today, we have the knowledge but do we also have the zeal? What are the differences between the righteousness of man and the righteousness of God? 

+ **Fidelity** - All who call on His name will be saved. But to call His name one must first believe. To believe one must first hear the gospel. To hear one must be preached. It is through God's sovereignty that we are elected. It is through God's grace that we believe. But it is our responsibility to preach. Are there people around me to whom I can preach and give them the opportunity to hear gospel?
