### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Ishmael's descendants. God's promise is never unfulfilled. 

+ As God has promised, Ishmael became the father of 12 tribes. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Ishmael was conceived by human will. Although he was not the chosen son but God still blessed him. Ishmael was the ancestor of the Arabs today. How should I treat the offspring of Ishmael?
