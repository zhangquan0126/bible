### Question     
How does the Lord call His people to repent and return to Him?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Rebuke all those who take oaths in the name of the Lord and invoke the God of Israel-but not in truth or righteousness. 

+ Rebuke all those who are treacherous and were rebellious from birth. 

+ The Lord for His name's sake delays His wrath; for the sake of His praise He holds it back from them. 

+ Calling all to listen to the Lord, Leave Babylon, flee from the Babylonians! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth; say, "The Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - We benefit from the Lord's teaching and from His leading us to walk on the His way. If we obey, we'd be blessed because fearing God is the beginning of wisdom. Do I fear Him in how I act and am willing to seek His will? Or, do I just go my own way by my own will? Why is it that I sometimes don't listen to Him?
