### Question     
What did Jesus teach the crowd followed Him?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ Jesus picked twelve of His disciples to become apostles. 

+ Jesus preached to the crowd on a level place about the blessings and the woes. 

+ Jesus talked about removing the plank from one’s own eyes before taking a speck out of others’ eyes. 

+ Fruit trees are identified by the fruits they bear. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** – Jesus prayed whole night before selecting His twelve apostles. Am I following God’s guidance and His will to act upon? Is there anything I need to pray and ask God for? 

+ **Identity** – The blessings and woes in God’s eyes are totally different from the world’s. How do I know what is the true blessing? Or, what appears to be blessing would bring woe? Do I have a complete and clear understanding of God’s value and am willing to act upon it?
