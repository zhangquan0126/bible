### Question     
What were the outcomes for Cush and Egypt?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God’s Story   
+ The people of Cush are feared far and wide. The gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the Lord Almighty. 

+ The Lord is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, the officials of Zoan are nothing but fools, the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. 

+ There will be an altar to the Lord in the heart of Egypt. When they cry out to the Lord because of their oppressors, He will send them a savior and defender, and He will rescue them. 

+ The king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** – When the Egyptians cry out to the Lord, He sends them a savior. How am I following God’s love of all people to love those who are different from me?
