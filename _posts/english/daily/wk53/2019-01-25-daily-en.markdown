### Question     
Why did the Lord elect David as king of Israel?

{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ God sent Samuel to Bethlehem to anoint a new king. 

+ The Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. 

+ The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and a harmful spirit from the Lord tormented him. Saul's servant suggested to have David play lyre for Saul to refresh him to make him well. 

+ The Philistines and the Israelites went to war, David relied on God to defeat Goliath; The Israelites defeated the Philistines and plundered Philistine camp; David now entered the sights of Saul and the Israelites. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. What is the heart that is pleasing to God according to the words Samuel said to Saul (vs. 15:22-23)? How Samuel's words were reflected in what David said and acted when he defeated Goliath? How shall I make my heart pleasing to God? 

+ **Integrity** - What was David's focus in his speech and action when defeating Goliath? What was he relying on? Did he know his mission? How may I defeat the tall and seemingly undefeatable giants in my life I'd inevitably meet?
