How was Israel being arrogant against the Lord?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord. But the Israelites ask, how are we to return? 

+ Israel are robbing the Lord in tithes and offerings. 

+ Israel have spoken arrogantly against the Lord, for they said, it is futile to serve God, what do we gain by carrying out His requirements? 

+ A scroll of remembrance was written in His presence concerning those who feared the Lord and honored His name. 

+ Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on fire. 

+ Remember the law of Moses. I will send the prophet Elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the Lord comes. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - The Israelites said it is futile to serve the Lord, nothing is gain by carrying out His command. The Lord said this is arrogance. Have I complained in my services? Do I understand the benefit of obeying God's command?
