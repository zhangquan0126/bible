### Question     
How did Solomon construct the temple?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Solomon began to build the temple on the threshing floor of Arunah. 

+ Solomon laid for building the temple of God using the cubit of the old standard. 

+ For the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold. 

+ For the front of the temple he made two pillars, a bronze altar, and the Sea of cast metal. 

+ He then made ten basins for washing, ten gold lampstands. He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court. 

+ Huram also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Solomon used precious materials and delicate tools with detailed methodology. When I serve, how may I serve with all my heart, all my mind, all my soul, and all my strength to glorify God?
