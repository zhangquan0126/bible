### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The two and half tribes of the east kept their promise to carry out the mission God gave them to help their fellow Israelites obtain their lands. Afterward, Joshua blessed them and asked them to serve and walk in obedience of the Lord. He reminded them to share the plunders of war with their fellow Israelites and sent them home. 

+ The two and half tribes built an imposing altar near Jordan River. This brought suspicion from the nine and half tribes that they were serving other gods. Israelites sent priest Phinehas and heads of the nine and half tribes to question them. They gently proclaimed their faith in the Lord to resolved the situation and turned tension into peace. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Community** - Looking at the misunderstanding between the nine and half tribes of the west and the two and half tribes of the east. What does it remind me of in my relationships with my co-workers, family, and spouse? How should I treat those who seem to have done something wrong?
