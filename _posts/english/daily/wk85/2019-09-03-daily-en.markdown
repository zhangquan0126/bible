### Question     
What did Jerusalem do to displease God?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The Lord said, as I have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire, so will I treat the people living in Jerusalem. 

+ The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel to confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices. 

+ The Lord said to Jerusalem, as you lay there in your blood I said to you, Live! 

+ Jerusalem trusted in her beauty and used her fame to become a prostitute. 

+ In addition to all her other wickedness, Jerusalem built a mound for herself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. 

+ The Lord will gather all her lovers, with whom she found pleasure, those she loved as well as those she hated. He would gather them against her from all around. 

+ The Lord will deal with those who despised their oath and breaking the covenant as they deserve. 

+ The Lord will remember the covenant He made with Jerusalem in the days of her youth and will establish an everlasting covenant with her. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God likened Jerusalem as a prostitute to depict her sinfulness. What attributes of God do I see in this? How shall I answer to God's holiness and purity?
