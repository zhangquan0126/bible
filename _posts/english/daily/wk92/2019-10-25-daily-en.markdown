### Question     
Why does God judge Edom?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The vision came to Obadiah from the Lord about Edom, I will make you small among the nations; you will be utterly despised. 
+ Because of the violence against your brother Jacob, you will be covered with shame; you will be destroyed forever. 
+ The day of the Lord is near for all nations. Your deeds will return upon your own head. 
+ But on Mount Zion will be deliverance; it will be holy, and Jacob will possess his inheritance. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - The pride of your heart has deceived you, you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights, you who say to yourself, 'Who can bring me down to the ground?' Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down, declares the Lord. Am I deceived by my pride? How does God's judgment to Edom alert me?
