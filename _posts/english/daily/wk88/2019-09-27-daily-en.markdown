How was Daniel taken to Babylon?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it, and the Lord delivered Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand. 

+ The king ordered Ashpenaz, chief of his court officials, to bring into the king's service some young Israelites from the royal family and the nobility, without any physical defect, handsome, showing aptitude for every kind of learning, well informed, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king's palace. He was to teach them the language and literature of Babylonians. 

+ Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine. 

+ They ate and drink nothing but vegetables and water and they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food. 

+ God gave them knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning. And Daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Daniel and his three companions separated themselves so they wouldn't be defiled by eating royal food. Was that necessary? How may I separate myself from the environment I live in?
