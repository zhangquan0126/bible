+ The astrologers answered the king, there is no one on earth who can do what king asks! 

+ The king was so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon. 

+ Daniel went in to the king and asked for time, so that he might interpret the dream for him. 

+ Daniel and his friends plead for mercy from the God concerning this mystery. 

+ Daniel answered the king that God reveals mysteries and He has shown king Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come. 

+ Daniel spoke of the king's dream, before the king stood a large statue.

+ The king Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrated before Daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.
